I am a theoretical and computational chemistry PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins University.
I research laser cooling, molecular conical intersections, and nonadiabatic dynamics of photochemical reactions by performing quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations on supercomputers.
